# Drone Journalism Lab Operations Manual

This operations manual will attempt to begin to codify the practice of using small flying vehicles to report news, as well as guide news organizations on how to develop their own best practies. The manual, in it's current configuration, is divided into four parts.

This manual's hosting on GitHub is no accident. It will be updated iteratively. Your input is welcome. 

The manual was created with support from the [__Knight Foundation__](http://www.knightfoundation.org/).
